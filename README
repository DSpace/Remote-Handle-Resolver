Remote-Handle-Resolver is a storage plugin for the Handle System 
resolver, which forwards requests to remote DSpace instances for 
resolution.  DSpace serves as the "database" for resolving Handle 
lookups.

To use this, place the built JAR in the resolver's classpath and 
configure the resolver to use 
org.dspace.handle.MultiRemoteDSpaceRepositoryHandlePlugin as the storage 
back-end.  See the Handle resolver documentation for details.

The plugin must be configured with the location of the remote DSpace 
instances.  Create a file named "handle-dspace-plugin.cfg" in the 
resolver's directory.  This file is in Java serialized Properties 
format.  All properties beginning with "dspace.handle.endpoint" will be
loaded:

   dspace.handle.endpoint  = http://localhost:8080/xmlui/handleresolver
   dspace.handle.endpoint2 = http://localhost:8181/xmlui/handleresolver
   dspace.handle.endpoint3 = http://localhost:8181/xmlui/handleresolver

This allows you to run the Handle server on a separate machine than your
DSpace instance.  If you use one Handle server for several DSpace
instances, please have in mind that they will still need to use distinct
handle prefixes.
